# Hello-World
Welcome

I'm a person who enjoys simple things in life, my favorite food, my hobbies, and seeing cute animals.
However this causes me to lose sight of a bigger picture in life, this doesn't affect any work of mine but sometimes i'll start to wonder where I am or where i'm going.

I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science recently.
I did so because I want to work with computers, I learned that I love computers or I learned how much I really love computers.
They are the base of our current world and they allowed us to do many things that were once difficult or even impossible.

I'm not sure if I want to be one of those people who makes a big change, but I do know that I want to be someone who is better than who I am now. 
So I chose computers, because they are always getting better.
Hardware gets stronger, Software gets faster, Peripherals get cheaper and more ergonomic
I want to build of these things, at least something to make things better.
For me, and for everyone.

At the very least, I want to get better.
